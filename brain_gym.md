##Question One

You stand at a fork in the road. Next to each of the two forks, there stands a guard. You know the following things: First that one path leads to paradise, the other leads to Death. You cannot distinguish between the two paths. You also know that one of the two guards always tells the truth and the other always lies. You have permission to ask one guard one question to discover which path leads to paradise. What one question would you ask to guarantee you take the path to paradise?

###Answer

Say to either guard, "If I ask the other guard which direction leads to paradise, what direction would he point me in?" This works because the liar will point to death, because he knows the honest guard will direct you towards paradise. The honest guard will point to death as well, because he knows he'll lie. So, whatever path either guard points at, take the other one.

##Question Two

A man walks into an art gallery and concentrates on one picture in particular. The museum curator notices this and asks the man why he is so interested in that one painting. The man replies, "Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man's father is my father's son."

*Who is in the painting?*

###Answer

The curator is in the painting. He has no siblings, so the man in the paiting is his father, and his father's son is him.
